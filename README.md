# To make this ready for production

## Auto Rebuild System (nice to have)
I had to triage this as my initial attempts did not quite do it. 
With a bit more time, I would have researched Fastify solutions for this 
or else worked to get the solution in synch from the esbuild configurations.

I have done this with simple esbuild solutions before, but had issues chaining them in the time alloted


## Replace the mockServiceWorker
Since, you know, it says to not use it in production.
Turns out just shutting this off works fine.
This will make me a bit crazy later and I will look into a more complete solution if there is one.
